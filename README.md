# chess-learning-app

## Current Objectives

- Build a full-stack application to help facilitate learning chess
  - Opening/Middle/Endgame practice
  - Real-time games
  - Play Against Bots (probably stockfish)
  - Analytics page (plan to do right after implementing MVP features (aka the three above points))
  - Stretch: Build a real-time chess collaboration tool (the idea is for a chess teacher to open a session, invite their students, and be able to move pieces, set positions, etc, all the while the students are able to see exactly whats happening (positions, arrows, piece movements, etc.))
- Learn cool tech
  - Next.js on frontend
  - Figure out how to use Stockfish
  - Nest.js on backend
  - Websockets to handle real-time features
  - Use Lichess API for handy chess data
  - Redis for caching + pub/sub for horizontally scaling websockets
